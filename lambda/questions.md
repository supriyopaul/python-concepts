1. **Basic:**
   - Write a lambda function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. What should the output be when you call this function with the arguments 5 and 3?

2. **Advanced:**
   - Write a lambda function that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. Use this lambda function with the `map()` function to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The list of temperatures is [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]. What should the output be?

3. **Intermediate:**
   - Lambda with Conditional Logic: A lambda function that returns True if a number is even, False otherwise.

4. **Intermediate-Advanced:**
   - Lambda in List Comprehension: Using a lambda function inside a list comprehension to square numbers in a list.

5. **Advanced:**
   - Lambda with `map()`: Using a lambda function with `map()` to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

6. **Expert:**
   - Lambda with `filter()` and `map()`: Using a lambda function with `filter()` and `map()` to find squares of even numbers in a list.

7. **Expert:**
   - Write a lambda function that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, False otherwise. Use this lambda function with the `filter()` function to find all prime numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. What should the output be?

8. **Expert:**
   - Write a lambda function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all consonants removed. Use this lambda function with the `map()` function to process a list of strings. The list of strings is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]. What should the output be?

9. **Expert:**
   - Write a lambda function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all strings sorted in alphabetical order. Use this lambda function with the `map()` function to process a list of strings. The list of strings is ["orange", "apple", "banana", "cherry"]. What should the output be?

10. **Intermediate-Advanced:**
    - Write a lambda function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared. Use this lambda function in a list comprehension to process the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. What should the output be?
