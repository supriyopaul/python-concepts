1. Given the list `numbers = [1,  2,  3,  4,  5]`, use `map` to create a new list where each number is squared. The expected output is `[1,  4,  9,  16,  25]`.
2. For the list `words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`, use `map` to create a new list where each word is capitalized. The expected output is `['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']`.
3. Given the list `ages = [25,  30,  35,  40]`, use `map` to create a new list where each age is multiplied by  1.5. The expected output is `[37.5,  45.0,  52.5,  60.0]`.
4. For the list `temperatures = [0,  10,  20,  30]`, use `map` to create a new list where each temperature is converted to Fahrenheit. The expected output is `[32,  50,  68,  86]`.
5. Given the list `names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']`, use `map` to create a new list where each name is followed by a comma and space. The expected output is `['Alice, ', 'Bob, ', 'Charlie, ']`.
6. For the list `numbers = [1,  2,  3,  4,  5]`, use `map` to create a new list where each number is incremented by  1. The expected output is `[2,  3,  4,  5,  6]`.
7. Given the list `squares = [1,  4,  9,  16,  25]`, use `map` to create a new list where each square is the square root of the number. The expected output is `['1.0', '2.0', '3.0', '4.0', '5.0']`.
8. For the list `words = ['hello', 'world']`, use `map` to create a new list where each word is reversed. The expected output is `['olleh', 'dlrow']`.
9. Given the list `numbers = [1,  2,  3,  4,  5]`, use `map` to create a new list where each number is converted to a string. The expected output is `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
10. For the list `sentences = ['The cat is black.', 'The dog is brown.']`, use `map` to create a new list where each sentence is converted to lowercase. The expected output is `['the cat is black.', 'the dog is brown.']`.
