1. **Given two lists `names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']` and `ages = [25, 30, 35]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a name and an age. The expected output is `[('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]`.**

2. **For the lists `numbers = [1, 2, 3]` and `squares = [1, 4, 9]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a number and its square. The expected output is `[(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)]`.**

3. **Given two lists `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']` and `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a letter and a number. The expected output is `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.**

4. **For the lists `words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` and `lengths = [5, 6, 6]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a word and its length. The expected output is `[('apple', 5), ('banana', 6), ('cherry', 6)]`.**

5. **Given two lists `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` and `colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'red']`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a fruit and its color. The expected output is `[('apple', 'red'), ('banana', 'yellow'), ('cherry', 'red')]`.**

6. **For the lists `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` and `prices = [1.0, 0.5, 2.0]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a fruit and its price. The expected output is `[('apple', 1.0), ('banana', 0.5), ('cherry', 2.0)]`.**

7. **Given two lists `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a number and its square. The expected output is `[(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]`.**

8. **For the lists `words = ['hello', 'world']` and `lengths = [5, 5]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a word and its length. The expected output is `[('hello', 5), ('world', 5)]`.**

9. **Given two lists `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `cubes = [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a number and its cube. The expected output is `[(1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27), (4, 64), (5, 125)]`.**

10. **For the lists `words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` and `prices = [1.0, 0.5, 2.0]`, use `zip` to create a new list where each element is a tuple of a word and its price. The expected output is `[('apple', 1.0), ('banana', 0.5), ('cherry', 2.0)]`.**
